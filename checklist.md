### Checklist of concepts to learn:
Mathematics for ML:
- [x] [Probability & Statistics (Bayesâ€™ theorem, distributions, hypothesis testing)](https://github.com/ivymorenomt/mlNotes/blob/main/probabilityandstats.md)
- [] Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, PCA for data analysis)
- [] Optimization (Gradient Descent, Lagrange multipliers, convex optimization)
- [] Information Theory (Entropy, KL divergence for measuring model uncertainty)
- [] Time Series Analysis (if relevant to your migraine app)

ML Core Concepts:
- [] Model evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, PR Curve)
- [] Bias-variance tradeoff (Detecting overfitting & underfitting)
- [] Feature importance & explainability (SHAP, LIME)
- [] Regularization techniques (L1/L2, dropout)
- [] Cross-validation (k-fold, stratified)
